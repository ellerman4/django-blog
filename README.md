# Personal Django Blog

A blog site made with Django framework.  I'll be posting various cs concepts I learn here, in order to "learn by teaching".  Will not be super well structured, 
and should not be used as a learning resource.

Posts can be easily added/edited through the Django admin panel.

```python
python manage.py runserver
```
